# Geo Ranking

Geo Ranking is an educational and playful project that lets users explore and compare countries through interactive rankings ("Top 10" style) based on real-world indicators (population, GDP, internet usage, etc.). The data is fetched from the [World Bank API](https://data.worldbank.org/) and stored locally for performance and consistency.
